The Vast Supper is an upcoming game by Starship Delivery, a student-run dev studio made by University of California, Santa Cruz students for CMPM 170, 171, and 172. It focuses on exploration, with the players foraging for ingredients during the day and cooking them to serve to customers at night. Current plans are for five alien levels to explore, full of fun alien ingredients and platforming challenges the player must overcome to collect them. We plan to release on Steam at the end of CMPM 172, make sure to wishlist us then! There will be a blog post announcing it.
