Starship Delivery for 02/03/2024! We've been working hard on getting some visual flair done for our project, as we've been reevaluating our end goal with it. We've got it pretty well-figured out by now, but in the meantime we've made some awesome progress!
- Started work on the exterior ship design for the player's main base
- Finished implementing the player's movement and the test level, we should be able to start on adding the 'juice' pretty soon!!
- Started work on our inventory system, no point to foraging when there's nothing to hold all the forage in!
- Implemented other UX such as menus, a day/night cycle, and the ability to save and load
- Begun work on the cooking mechanics and minigames, to be fully ramped up in Sprint 2
