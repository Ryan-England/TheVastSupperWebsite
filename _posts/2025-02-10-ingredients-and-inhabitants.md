Vast Supper 02/03-02/09 updates:
🌋  Worked on creating our Lava asset, a common obstacle in this world.
🐌  Here's a WIP glimpse at the alien species for this level, inspired by the banana slugs around campus!
🌾  Similarly, here's a look at the Cinderwheat you'll be able to collect throughout the level, to grind up and bake into bread!
🤤  Worked on our cooking systems this week, although unfortunately they are still under development for now. Look forward to seeing them next Monday! 🤞
