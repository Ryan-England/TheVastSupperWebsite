The Vast Supper 02/10-02/16 updates:

🧂 We've got collectable ingredients in the world! Salt and Cinderwheat are essential ingredients you'll use to make many dishes.

👩‍🍳 We've set up a system where NPCs will walk up and request dishes from the player! Now we're just a table and a menu away from being a proper restaurant!

🧑‍💻 We've got JSON set up in Unity! It was a surprisingly large up-front investment (and took a lot longer than we thought it would), but it's worth it because it will allow us to scale Recipes, Dialog, Quests, and Items extremely easily in the future!

🗺️ We have a minimap! It's a bit small for now, but it shows the player's location and the surrounding area to help prevent players from being lost. It also has map pointers that highlight important objects, including when Customers approach the player for a meal!

👨‍🔬 Interested in any of our progress so far? Reach out to play during our next Playtest on Thursday!
